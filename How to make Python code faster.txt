1. Use less print() statements. Especially not inside long loops, since IO operations preempt the process from CPU and thus the overhead slows down the process.
2. Use sys module for faster operations
3. Make batch inserts in database. It is useful since only one write lock will be created and db connection won't be called for every record separately.
4. Use messsge packs for JSON.
